🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 remains one of the most studied maritime disasters in history. Using passenger demographic and travel data, this project builds a supervised machine learning model to predict survival outcomes.

Perform structured data preprocessing
Engineer meaningful features
Build and evaluate classification models
Interpret model performance in a business-relevant way
Develop an end-to-end ML pipeline

This simulates a real-world predictive analytics system used in risk modeling and decision intelligence.
